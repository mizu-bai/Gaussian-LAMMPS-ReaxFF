# Gaussian-LAMMPS-ReaxFF

## Introduction

For some reason, I have to compare the ReaxFF and DFT results, so I have no choice but to write this glue code.

## Usage

In `src`, there is a script for `CHON-2017_w` forcefield. If one wants to switch to other forcefields, modify all settings about atoms.

In `example`, folder `H2O` is an optimization task while `HCN` is a transition state search task.

**NOTE**: `opt=nomicro` & `freq=num`
